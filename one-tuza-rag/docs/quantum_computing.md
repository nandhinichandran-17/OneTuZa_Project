# Quantum Computing Overview

Quantum computing leverages quantum bits (qubits) which can exist in superposition, enabling exponential parallelism. Unlike classical bits, qubits can represent both 0 and 1 at the same time.

Key features:
- *Superposition*: Qubits can encode multiple states simultaneously.
- *Entanglement*: Qubits can be linked, creating correlations stronger than classical physics allows.
- *Quantum gates*: Operate on qubits to perform transformations.

Applications:
- Optimization problems
- Quantum chemistry simulations
- Machine learning speedups
- Cryptanalysis (breaking RSA, ECC)

Challenges:
- Qubit decoherence
- Error correction
- Scalability and hardware limitations
