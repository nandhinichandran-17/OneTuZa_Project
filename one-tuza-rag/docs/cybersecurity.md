# Cybersecurity in the Modern Era

Cybersecurity focuses on protecting data, networks, and systems from unauthorized access and attacks.

Key Threats:
- *Malware*: Viruses, worms, ransomware
- *Phishing*: Social engineering to steal credentials
- *Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)*: Long-term, targeted attacks
- *Cryptographic risks*: Weaknesses in algorithms and key management

Quantum Computing Impact:
- Current public-key cryptosystems (RSA, ECC) are vulnerable to Shor's algorithm.
- Symmetric cryptography (AES) is less affected but may need larger key sizes.

Mitigation Strategies:
- Transition to *Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)* algorithms (lattice-based, hash-based, multivariate).
- Use *hybrid encryption* combining classical and quantum-resistant methods.
- Increase *key lengths* for symmetric ciphers.
- Invest in *quantum key distribution (QKD)* for ultra-secure communication.
