# Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve performance without explicit programming.

## Types of Learning
- **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data (e.g., regression, classification).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds hidden patterns (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns through trial and error using rewards.

## Key Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees & Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

## Applications
- Predictive analytics
- Natural language processing
- Computer vision
- Recommender systems
